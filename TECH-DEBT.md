# photohelper — Tech-Debt Ledger

> Known shortcuts taken for velocity, each with a remediation plan and a
> **binding trigger**. This ledger is the canonical view of "where the codebase
> trades off quality vs. velocity right now."
>
> Policy: see `CLAUDE.md § No Acceptable Trade-offs Policy`. A stop-gap without
> a TD entry here is a process violation; a deferral without a plan is a
> CRITICAL finding on its own (`docs/quality-assurance.md § Findings triage`).

## Entry format

Each TD has a stable ID (`TD-NNN`) and these fields:

```markdown
### TD-NNN — <descriptive title>

- **Status**: Open | Closed (YYYY-MM-DD, session N; reason)
- **Opened**: YYYY-MM-DD (session N)
- **Stop-gap location**: <file:line> @ <commit-sha>
- **Fundamental fix**: <concrete implementation outline — not "investigate">
- **Binding trigger**: <rev-list-anchored | by YYYY-MM-DD | event-driven>
- **Scope estimate**: <~LoC> / <risk: low|med|high>
- **Consequence of inaction**: <if unaddressed, X happens>
- **Related**: <links to code-review artifacts, discovery-notes, ADRs>
```

## Open

### TD-001 — GitHub Actions action versions use `@vN` floating tags, not pinned SHAs

- **Status**: Open
- **Opened**: 2026-05-27 (session 0)
- **Stop-gap location**: `.github/workflows/ci.yml` (all `uses:` lines tagged `<<pin to SHA>>`) @ bootstrap commit
- **Fundamental fix**: replace every `actions/checkout@v4`, `dtolnay/rust-toolchain@stable`, `Swatinem/rust-cache@v2` with the corresponding commit SHA from the action's repo; commit a `docs/decisions/0001-action-version-pinning.md` recording the SHAs chosen and the upgrade cadence. Add a periodic refresh task (Dependabot or scheduled session).
- **Binding trigger**: before the first PR from an external contributor merges, OR before the first GitHub Release tag is cut — whichever comes first.
- **Scope estimate**: ~20 LoC across `.github/workflows/ci.yml` + one new decision doc / low risk
- **Consequence of inaction**: a compromised upstream action could exfiltrate secrets or inject code into the build; the `<<pin to SHA>>` comments are visible reminders but not enforced.
- **Related**: `docs/discovery-notes.md` (none yet — this is a self-contained debt)
